h2. About

jQuery Quotate is a plugin for "jQuery":http://jquery.com that displays a randomly selected quote in a @div@ or other block element. It can be customized to rotate the quote at a set interval or just show one quote every time the page reloads.

h2. Usage

<pre>
	$(document).ready(function() {
		$(".quote_element").quotate({
			type: "json", // accepts "json", "xml", or "list"
			quoteFile: "/quotes.json", // the file with the list of quotes if type is "json" or "xml" 
			// otherwise give an array of objects to quoteList
			// i.e. quoteList: [{quote:'quote', author:'Joe Somebody'}, {quote:'foo', author:'Bob Bar'}],
			interval: 10 // how often to rotate quotes, in seconds
		});
	})
</pre>
